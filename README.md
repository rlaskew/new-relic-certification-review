## April 2020 - New Relic Certification Review

Background:  While I normally work on Cloud+Kubernetes projects, I was recently assigned some work in the observability space -- so I needed to get some New Relic skills. Having done some of the cloud certifications offered by the big 3 vendors, I decided to make this my entry point for learning about New Relic. They have some free training at learn.newrelic.com but I decided to stick to the learning required for the cert because I didn’t really know what I was going to be learning or what was otherwise a good entry/exit point. It helped that both the training and the cert are FREE as of this writing. 

- Certification Name: New Relic APM Fundamentals Certification
- Cost: Free
- Link: https://learn.newrelic.com/series/fundamentals
- Resources Used:  My work New Relic account(s) and that’s really it.  I did onboard a node script to APM, but for this I just needed an app/api style key. 
- Time Commitment: About 10 hours estimated, although I didn’t measure it. 
- Level of Difficulty: Low if you are an IT pro,  probably still low-ish if you’re not, but you won’t get as much from the exercise.  

Training Format:  There are 3 short tests you have to pass each with one or two associated learning modules:  New Relic Fundamentals, APM and Insights fundamentals, and Alerting fundamentals --- If you are new to New Relic like I was then you’ll get the most out of the first part.  

Learning Format:  The typical format is watch a 5 min video -- where you can perform similar actions if you have an account setup already and populated with data -- then take a repeatable (which they encourage!) and mostly multiple choice quiz.  This repeats 7-10 times per module.

Summary:  This is a great free time-boxed intro to New Relic generally -- the learning and exam(s) give you a great overview of components of the software offered by New relic. If you’ve got experience with other platforms then the easiest way to ramp up with New Relic is to blow through this on a Saturday.  Taking and retaking quizzes and some light follow along in New Relic was really helpful in learning, compared to just watching some videos where I might have forgotten everything already.  

Things I didn’t try:
- Infrastructure Exam: I checked my certification track profile after I was awarded the badge and my learning progress wasn’t reset,  so I’m wondering if I completed the infrastructure exam would they award the infrastructure fundamentals badge -- from looking at credential.net there are separate badges for each which the main web page sort of hints at, even though there is not learning equivalent for the infrastructure exam 
- New Relic 14 Day Trial (is this a thing?) -- since i used my work New Relic account, i didn’t need the trial account for learning purposes   

Minor Complaints: 
- Some of those quizzes were long! Yikes
- A few glitches were present -- mostly in the APM module -- in the quiz questions (multiple same answers, wrong sized images, etc)
- I’d assume the infrastructure badge addition is a work in progress, that was just sort of added recently and made the training breadcrumbs harder to follow.

You're a New Relic Certified Performance Pro!

Badging:  So after 5 business days of the final button press, I got an email from Accreditable/Crediental.net  saying I was a “New Relic Certified Performance Pro”  which is the title of the cert they retired in 2019 (or early 2020?)  and replaced with this new program, but the badging was right: “New Relic APM Fundamentals Certification”
